# Email Draft to Matic Co-founder

**Subject:** Solving the #1 Request from Reddit: Local MQTT Bridge for Matic

**To:** [Co-founder's Name]
**From:** Aarush Agarwal

Hi [Name],

I'm a huge fan of what you're building at Matic. The privacy-first, computer-vision-driven approach is exactly what the smart home industry has been waiting for.

I saw your recent engagement on Reddit, and I noticed a recurring request from the community: **Home Assistant / MQTT integration.** The enthusiast crowd wants to integrate Matic into their wider smart homes, but they're blocked by the lack of an API.

**So, I built a solution.**

I've developed the **Matic Home Hub**—a lightweight, local-first bridge that connects Matic robots to Home Assistant via MQTT.

It aligns perfectly with your philosophy:
*   **🔒 Privacy First:** It runs 100% locally. No map data or video feeds ever leave the user's network.
*   **⚡ Zero Latency:** Commands are executed instantly via local Wi-Fi.
*   **🤝 Universal Compatibility:** It translates Matic's internal protocol into standard MQTT, making it compatible with Home Assistant, Node-RED, Hubitat, and more.

**You can see it in action here:**
*   **Live UI Demo:** [Insert Your GitHub Pages Link Here]
*   **Source Code:** [Insert Your GitHub Repo Link Here]

I believe this project could be a massive win for Matic. It satisfies the power users (who are your best evangelists) without requiring your team to divert focus from the core product.

I'd love to hear your thoughts. I'm happy to transfer this repo to the Matic organization or collaborate on making this an official community integration.

Best regards,
